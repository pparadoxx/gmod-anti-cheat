-- Made by paradox

This was a basic lua detecting anti-cheat I made in a few minutes, its pretty secure and detects most public lua cheats curently. I'm definity making more anti-cheats at some po-
int, however im not exactly sure when I will.

Heres a list of things I want to add:

Table detection using debug.getmetatable(_G)

Concommand check

Hook.GetAll() check

Crash games (_restart worked but im stupid so now it doesn't)

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Burst code

Fuck with key binds (turn this shit into HAC)

Fuck with _G and remove all of our stuff from _G

-----------------------
If you find a bypass feel free to open an issue but the screengrab stuff really doesn't count (relies off the fact that Phizz is big dumb).
